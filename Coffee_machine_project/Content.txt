# ‚òï Python Coffee Machine Simulator

This is a terminal-based simulation of a coffee machine built using Python. The user can order drinks like **espresso**, **latte**, or **cappuccino**, and the machine will manage resources, accept coins, return change, and track profit.

## üìã Features

- Offers 3 types of drinks: `espresso`, `latte`, `cappuccino`
- Tracks resources (`water`, `milk`, `coffee`) and profit
- Checks if resources are sufficient for each order
- Accepts coin inputs and calculates total amount
- Returns change if payment exceeds drink cost
- Provides `report` to show current resources and profit
- Allows shutdown via `"end"` command

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. The program starts and prompts the user:
What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino):

yaml
Copy code

2. Based on the choice:
- If `"report"` is entered: shows current machine status.
- If `"end"` is entered: shuts down the machine.
- If a drink is chosen:
  - Checks if enough resources are available.
  - Prompts the user to insert coins.
  - Calculates total payment and returns change if needed.
  - Prepares the drink if payment is sufficient.
  - Deducts used ingredients from available resources.
